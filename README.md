# SSB Spec Repository

This repo contains a spec for secure scuttlebutt, written as an [mdBook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/cli/serve.html). Unlike the [protocol guide](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide), this is not to be a linear read to quickly get something working. Rather it aims to be a comprehensive reference of how scuttlebutt works.
