# SSB Spec Repository

This repo contains a spec for secure scuttlebutt. Unlike the [protocol guide](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide), this is not to be a linear read to quickly get something working. Rather it aims to be a comprehensive reference of how scuttlebutt works. It is organized in a fractal fashion, ideally the reader can "zoom in" into as much detail as needed, from an abstract nderstanding down to the actual zeros and ones.
